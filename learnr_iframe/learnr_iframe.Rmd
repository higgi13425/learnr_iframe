## Topic 1

### Exercise 1

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to select the variables mpg and cylinder:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
  select()
```

### Exercise 2

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now filter to rows with mpg > 30 in the code chunk below

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

mtcars %>% 
  filter()
```
