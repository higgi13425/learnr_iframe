```{r setup, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scracth can be time consuming

### We will start with the tidy version from the {infer} package: t_test()

#### Notice that you have to state the order of the two levels of your grouping variable
---

```{r ttest1, include = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, am) %>% 
  filter(cyl > 5) %>%
  t_test(mpg~am, 
         order = c("0", "1"))
# Interpreting the results
# The t statistic is first
# followed by degrees of freedom
# then the p value
# the default alternative: two.sided
# then the confidence bounds
# output is a tibble so that it is 
# easy to use these results
```

`r chunk_reveal("ttest1", break_type = "auto", title = "Tidy version from the {infer} package")`


---

### Now we will use the baseR version: t.test()

#### Notice that you have to use   `data = .`
#### It is not quite as pipe-friendly
---

```{r ttest2, include = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, am) %>% 
  filter(cyl > 5) %>%
  t.test(mpg ~ am, data = .)
# Interpreting the results
# The t statistic is first
# followed by degrees of freedom
# then the p value
# then the alternative hypothesis
# then the confidence bounds
# then the mean mpg for each group
```

`r chunk_reveal("ttest2", break_type = "auto", title = "Base R Version")`

```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}
```
